# Cross-Chain Decentralized ID system

The project aims to create a decentralized, cross-chain identity verification system. 

This means building a system that allows you to prove your identity securely across different blockchains without having to repeat the KYC process each time you use a new service.

By leveraging Madara's modularity and Polkadot's interoperability, 
the application would enable users to verify their identity across different blockchains securely and privately, 
without the need for redundant KYC (Know Your Customer) processes on each chain.
